# PyExML
`pyexlab` extension using `torch` for machine learning

Author: Blake Wilson

## Overview

Running machine learning experiments can be a huge hassle. Optimizing hyper parameters, saving off specific data throughout epochs, and modifying models without breaking code are just a few of the headaches I come across on a daily basis. `pyexml` simplifies the design process for machine learning experimentation by building on top of the `pyexlab` package. 

This project is still in very early development!

## Setup

There are two ways to setup PyExML. Either, clone this repo and add the path to your virtual environment path. Or, you can install using PyPi. 

##Using PyExML
`pyexml` is an extension of `pyexlab`, and so both will need to be installed.
```
import pyexlab as pylab
import pyexml as pyml
```

## Creating ML Models

Models in `pyexml` are constructed the same way they are in `torch`. Simply specify the
